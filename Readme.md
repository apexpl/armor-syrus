# Example Armor Implementation

This is an example implementation of the Armor user and session management package utilizing the Syrus template engine.  This is not intended for production in any form, and is only meant for demonstration purposes, and to compliment the comprehensive Armor documentation to aide developers who are implementing Armor into their application.
